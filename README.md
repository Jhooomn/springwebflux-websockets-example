# springwebflux-websockets-example
An example of a reactive application using WebSockets and Spring WebFlux.

This example has a ticker service that generates stock prices and a client that allows you to get the changes for all stock tickers
streamed to you or allows you to subscribe to a single stock symbol and only get its changes streamed to you.

## Building the Example
Run the following command to build the example:

    ./gradlew clean build

## Running the Example
Follow the steps below to run the example application:

1. Start the `ticker-service` by running the following command:

        ./gradlew :ticker-service:bootRun
        
2. In a new terminal, run the following command to start the `ticker-client` and stream all stock tickers:

        ./gradlew :ticker-client:bootRun
        
    If successful, you will see prices streaming in as they change:

        [symbol: 'MCD', price: '217.04569062233392', volume: '3842459']
        [symbol: 'DWDP', price: '58.773564223813985', volume: '18439056']
        [symbol: 'V', price: '201.36407665460746', volume: '5068242']
        [symbol: 'JNJ', price: '54.7617904456654', volume: '4463539']
        [symbol: 'UTX', price: '26.037694121485202', volume: '5713780']
        [symbol: 'GS', price: '144.70238095792007', volume: '1470297']
        [symbol: 'GS', price: '426.9192178781588', volume: '3072623']
        
3. Now run the following command to subscribe only to Nike's (`NKE`) stock price changes:

        ./gradlew :ticker-client:bootRun --args="NKE"

    If successful, you will now only see `NKE` price change events streamed to you:

        [symbol: 'NKE', price: '182.39876004423166', volume: '127025']
        [symbol: 'NKE', price: '0.10341349711799158', volume: '4423692']
        [symbol: 'NKE', price: '0.43799636309273626', volume: '70043']
